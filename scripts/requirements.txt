# Python Requirements for Q59 Prime Candidate Repository
# ========================================================
#
# This project uses only Python standard library.
# No external packages are required for basic computation.
#
# Minimum Python version: 3.11
# Recommended: Python 3.11 or higher
#
# To verify your Python version:
#   python --version
#
# The computation requires:

#   - hashlib (standard library)
#   - time (standard library)
#   - os (standard library)
#
# All of these are included in Python by default.
#
# Optional packages for development/testing:
# -------------------------------------------

# For code formatting (optional)
black==23.12.1

# For linting (optional)
pylint==3.0.3

# For type checking (optional)
mypy==1.7.1

# Note: The core computation scripts work with zero dependencies
# beyond the Python standard library.
