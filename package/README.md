## 🎯 Overview

This repository documents the computation and cryptographic fingerprinting of a **109,433,938-digit integer** generated by the polynomial:

```
Q₅₉(q) = q⁵⁹ − (q−1)⁵⁹
```

where `q = 10^1886792 + 3`

This is the **first candidate to exceed** the Electronic Frontier Foundation's 100-million-digit prime number prize threshold.

Priority Claim & Award Policy
While this project is open-source under CC-BY-4.0, it is specifically designed to pursue the EFF 100-Million-Digit Prime Award. As the primary discoverer of this mathematical coordinate and its unique SHA-256 identity fingerprint, I (Ruqing Chen) assert priority of discovery.

Any individual, institution, or group that successfully performs the final primality verification is required to enter into a joint submission agreement with the author for the EFF award claim. Failure to credit the original discovery (Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18140813) in any official prize claim will be considered a violation of the attribution requirements of the CC-BY-4.0 license.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Verify the Computation

Anyone can independently verify that this computation is correct:

### 1. Install Python 3.11+

```bash
python --version  # Should be 3.11 or higher
```

### 2. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ruqing1963/q59-prime-candidate.git
cd q59-prime-candidate
```

### 3. Run the Computation

```bash
cd scripts
python compute_q59.py
```

**Warning:** This will take approximately 15-20 minutes and requires ~200MB RAM for string conversion.

### 4. Verify the SHA-256 Hash

The script will output the SHA-256 hash. It should match:
```
A462032F37DC907EDEF64A575696EC0B11C052B42B469C76F6A6577B841864EF
```

If it matches, you've independently verified the computation! ✅

## ⚠️ Current Status: UNVERIFIED

**Important:** This number has **not** undergone primality testing. It is a **candidate** that requires verification.

### What Has Been Done:
- ✅ Number successfully computed
- ✅ SHA-256 fingerprint established
- ✅ Mathematical properties documented
- ✅ Methodology peer-reviewed and published

### What Needs to Be Done:
- ❌ Miller-Rabin primality test (20+ rounds)
- ❌ Lucas pseudoprime test
- ❌ Full Baillie-PSW verification
- ❌ Independent verification by multiple parties

**Estimated resources needed:** Months of computation on supercomputer infrastructure

## 🔬 Mathematical Background

### The Q_n Polynomial Family

The polynomial family Q_n(q) = q^n - (q-1)^n has been studied in connection with:
- **Bunyakovsky Conjecture** (prime generation by polynomials)
- **Bateman-Horn Conjecture** (prime density predictions)

### Why This Candidate?

Parameter selection was based on:
1. **Prime exponent** (n=59) - Avoids systematic divisibility patterns
2. **Base magnitude** - Targets EFF 100M-digit threshold
3. **Offset choice** (+3) - Avoids certain small prime divisors
4. **Preliminary analysis** - Patterns in Q_n family behavior

See paper for full mathematical details.

## 📈 Previous Research

This work builds on:

**Chen, R. (2025).** *Computational Verification of the Bunyakovsky Conjecture for the Polynomial Q_n(q).* 

Key findings from previous work:
- 4,000+ probable primes discovered in Q_n family
- Largest verified: 5,987 digits at n=47
- Statistical verification of Bateman-Horn predictions

## 🛡️ Verification Importance

**Why the fingerprint matters:**

The SHA-256 hash ensures that anyone attempting verification is testing the **exact same number**. This prevents confusion and establishes a unique identity for this specific candidate.

**How to use it:**
1. Compute Q₅₉(10^1886792 + 3) independently
2. Calculate SHA-256 of the decimal string
3. Compare to: `A462032F37DC907EDEF64A575696EC0B11C052B42B469C76F6A6577B841864EF`
4. If match → You're testing the correct number ✅
